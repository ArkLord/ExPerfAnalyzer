## Running the script
    .\ExPerfAnalyzer.ps1 EXSERVER01_FULL_000001.BLG

## Registering script as a default handler
Execute the script with no parameters and it will register itself as a shell handler for perfmon .blg files. You can then right-click any .blg file and select *ExPerfAnalyzer* to quickly parse the log.

## Project Vision
The tool is a PowerShell script currently. We are investigating new platforms and technologies as PowerShell is not performant enough for us.

## Inspiration
This script was inspired by [Performance Analysis of Logs (PAL)](https://pal.codeplex.com) and PMA.VBS (an internal tool used by Windows support).
